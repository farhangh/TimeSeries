# Time series analysis
This package provides tools to statistically analyse the time series. 
The organisations where have cited in different corpuses are extracted and 
their citation evolution by time is studied. For each organisation, the 
variability, outlier inclusion, average number of citations and increase/decrease
tendency in citations are investigated.
